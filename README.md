## Description
### Introduction
The **Positive vs. Negative** program is a groundbreaking **CS50x** final project and web application that harnesses the power of **_Transformer_** models, introduced by Google Brain in 2017, to analyze the sentiment of text. This program is built on Python, Flask, Jinja, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It offers _sentiment analysis_ and _natural language processing (NLP)_ capabilities with wide-ranging applications in user experience enhancement. It is also crucial to the author a first personal project and offer better understanding in _Cognitive AI_.

At its core, the **Positive vs. Negative** program delves into the fascinating field of sentiment analysis, a subdomain of AI and NLP. Sentiment analysis involves using machine learning techniques to discern and understand the emotions, attitudes, and opinions conveyed through text. By employing Transformer models, which have revolutionized NLP, this project possesses the ability to not just interpret the text but also comprehend the underlying sense of others' messages. This endeavor holds profound importance, as it enables us to delve into the psyche of text authors, explore philosophical dimensions of communication, and conduct detailed studies on the nuances of authorship and expression. It places a strong emphasis on user safety, ensuring secure sign-in, and log-out procedures with hashed passwords. Additionally, it saves a history of user searches, allowing users to revisit their past analyses, highlights key sentimental words, and extracts top sentences. This unique feature aids users in quickly grasping the emotional essence of the content, making it an invaluable tool for both academics and everyday communication.

Moreover, the **Positive vs. Negative** program is designed with an eye toward future expansion. It aims to extend its capabilities by implementing models tailored for different languages, such as Vietnamese, using models like Pho-Bert. Additionally, it seeks to explore other utilities of Transformers, from translation to content generation, further harnessing the power of these AI marvels. User feedback and guesses will be harnessed to improve the model's performance through reinforcement learning, making it increasingly adept at understanding and analyzing sentiment.
